# Text Former

This is an application for organizing text into a friendlier form.
In many situations, the text we received is illy organized. For example,
a passage coped from a PDF file is splitted by many linebreaks, which
usually need us to remove them one by one. This application provide
a more elegant way to handle this kind of problems.

# Key Features

* `trim` -- Remove leading and trailing whitespace of a line;
